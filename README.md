# Vale Structs:
Header-only `C++` container and helper classes.

# Classes to Implement:
- [X] `vale::array`: a stack-allocated fixed-size array of objects
- [X] `vale::variant`: a type-safe union (in progress)
- [ ] `vale::vector`: a heap allocated variable-sized array
- [ ] `vale::string`: a string class with helpful methods for string manipulation
- [ ] `vale::list`: a linked list
- [ ] `vale::thread_pool`: a thread pool

# Goals:
- Implement a reusable skeleton of classes.
- Allow greater customization.
